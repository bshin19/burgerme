## Project Overview
![Burger App](https://github.com/bshin19/burgerme/blob/master/public/assets/img/burgermain.PNG)

Burger Me is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Burgers can then be "devoured".
+ Whenever a user submits a burger's name, it is displayed on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured!
+ Each burger in the waiting area has a "Devour it!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page and is "devoured."
+ Every burger is stored in a mysql database, whether devoured or not.
