## Burger Me

# Overview
+ Burger Me is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
+ Whenever a user submits a burger's name, it is displayed on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured!
+ Each burger in the waiting area has a "Devour it!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page and is "devoured."
+ Every burger is stored in a mysql database, whether devoured or not.
